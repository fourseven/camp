              We are returning to the now legendary venue of the first South Island camp, Mount Cheeseman Snowline Lodge.  Located at 1500m above sea level in the Craigieburn Range the lodge offers a comfortable and breathtaking location for the discerning Rails Camper.

            </p>

            <p>

            <ul>

              <li>A towel</li>
              <li>Clothes for warm *and* cold weather.  March is late summer in NZ and 
                there is the potential for a wide range of daytime temperatures during 
                the camp, and nights may be potentially cold at the high altitude of 
                the venue.</li>
              <li>Sunscreen.</li>
              <li>All necessary chargers / power adapters for any electronic equipment 
                you intend to bring.</li>
              <li>
                The venue is very isolated, so please ensure you bring any medication you require and additional necessary items with you.

                There will be <strong>NO CELLPHONE RECEPTION</strong> at the venue. Really ...  none.<br />
                Therefore, please make sure you have all the software and files you need 
                installed.  We will be running a mirror of rubygems.org, but to avoid 
                disappointment please assume that you need to be fully self sufficient for 
                any hacking you want to do.  For a good rule of thumb, imagine you are 
                MacGyver.

                You will be sharing dorm / bunkroom style accommodation with other attendees, so bring ear plugs / eye mask if you feel you will need them.

              <em>Matz is nice, and we are nice.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              In the same way that Matz has written Ruby with a focus on developer happiness, we are focused on community happiness. The New Zealand Ruby community is full of wonderful people from a diverse range of backgrounds, and we want to ensure it remains a welcoming and safe environment to all who wish to be a part of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whenever we come together as a community, our shared spaces are opportunities to showcase the best of what we can be. We are there to support our peers - to build each other up, to accept each other for who they are, and to encourage each other to become the people they want to be.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that in mind, if you are present at any Rails Camp NZ event, whether as an attendee, organiser, sponsor or speaker, we take it as given that you agree to follow this code of conduct:
            </p>
            <p>
              The Rails Camp NZ organisers are dedicated to providing harassment-free experiences at events and conferences for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or age. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.
            </p>
            <p>
              All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any circumstance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members of the community. Be respectful towards others. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Rails Camp NZ.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyone violating these rules at events may be asked to leave the event without a refund at the sole discretion of the organisers.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you or someone else is subject to harassment, or you have a concern, please contact the event organisers (who will introduce themselves at the beginning of the event).
            </p>
            <p>
              The Ruby and Rails communities are a welcoming and friendly place – thank you for being a part of it.
            </p>
